''' g++ -o memoryDB transactions.cpp

## Assignment Modification Suggestions
1. Additional Methods: introduce more complex functions, such as nested transactions or a requirement to support various data types.
2. Documentation: encourage students to include more detailed documentation/comments within their code to improve readability.
3. Ask students to create a simple command line interface or graphical user interface to interact with the database to enhance usability and user experience.
